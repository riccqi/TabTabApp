                <h3>üé® Fresh New Look</h3>
                <p>TabTab has a new look to better align with macOS 26. Redesigned icon and website at <a href="https://tabtabapp.net">tabtabapp.net</a></p>
                
                <h3>üìÇ Tabs Grouped by Windows</h3>
                <p>Many users have said that TabTab doesn't fit naturally into their existing workflows. This feature is a step towards making TabTab more natural to use.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tabs are now grouped by default, according to their window. You can click on the number to the right of the tab to see all other tabs in that same window.</li>
                    <li>When you start searching, TabTab shows all relevant tabs, regardless of their tab groups.</li>
                    <li>You can also use the left and right arrows to navigate in and out of the new grouped tabs page.</li>
                    <li>You can turn this off in settings to display all tabs at the same time.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>üë®‚Äçüîß Improved Tab Tracking Reliability</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Significantly improved tab tracking for many popular browsers: Google Chrome, Safari, Brave, Microsoft Edge.</li>
                    <li>Arc browser support (finally!!)</li>
                    <li>Browser favicons are now shown for these browsers in grouped tab mode</li>
                    <li>You can now search for tabs by their URL in these browsers</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>üëæ Other Big Improvements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All tabs are now registered on startup, you no longer have to click on them before they get added to TabTab.</li>
                    <li>TabTab now doubles as an app launcher when you search for apps that aren‚Äôt yet registered.</li>
                    <li>Redesigned onboarding flow</li>
                    <li>Redesigned settings</li>
                    <li>New option in settings to increase width of TabTab</li>

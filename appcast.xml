                <h2>TabTab 2.0 - The Biggest Update Yet</h2>
                <p>This is a free update for all users.</p>
                
                <h3>üé® Fresh New Look</h3>
                <p>TabTab has a new look to better align with macOS 26. Redesigned icon and website at <a href="https://tabtabapp.net">tabtabapp.net</a></p>
                
                <h3>üìÇ Tabs Grouped by Windows</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many users have said that TabTab doesn't fit naturally into their existing workflows. This feature is a step towards making TabTab more natural to use.</li>
                    <li>Tabs are now grouped by default, according to their window. You can click on the number to the right of the tab to see all other tabs in that same window.</li>
                    <li>You can also use the keyboard left and right arrows to navigate in and out of the new grouped tabs page</li>
                    <li>You can turn this off in settings to display all tabs at the same time</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>üë®‚Äçüîß Improved Tab Tracking Reliability</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Significantly improved tab tracking for many popular browsers: Google Chrome, Safari, Brave, Microsoft Edge</li>
                    <li>Arc browser support (finally!!)</li>
                    <li>Browser favicons are now shown for these browsers in grouped tab mode</li>
                    <li>Much improved search, with URL support for these browsers</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>üëæ Other Big Improvements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tabs are now registered upon startup of the app, you no longer have to click on them before they get added to TabTab</li>
                    <li>TabTab now also acts as an app launcher, when you search for apps that are not yet registered by TabTab</li>
                    <li>Redesigned onboarding flow</li>
                    <li>Redesigned settings</li>
                    <li>New option in settings to increase width of TabTab</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>üêõ Bug Fixes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Search box sometimes not getting focused when TabTab is presented</li>

                    <li>Fix CMD+Q and CMD+W to quit apps and windows not working for some users</li>
                    <li>Fix input into search bar that requires IME confirmation box</li>
                    <li>Many more fixes</li>

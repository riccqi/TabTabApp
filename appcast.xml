                <h2>TabTab 2.0.3 - Speed Improvements, Bug Fixes, Comet and Helium Support üéÉ</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Added tab tracking support for Comet and Helium browsers.</li>
                    <li>Disabling/enabling tab tracking should work much better now.</li>
                    <li>Improved speed of switching between tabs.</li>
                    <li>Holding down Tab to cycle through tabs now align with system keyboard repeat settings.</li>
                    <li>Mouse activation has been sped up, with a "Insant" option added in settings.</li>
                    <li>Opening TabTab and dismissing it with "Esc" key now refocuses the previous window.</li>
                    <li>Some apps were not being tracked when they were opened, this should be fixed now.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: I'm aware that Firefox vertical tab support is broken right now, I'm working on it. Thank you for your patience!</p>
